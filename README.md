Project Overview

Welcome to our repository for an innovative video chatting app designed to break down communication barriers between the deaf or hard-of-hearing community and those who are not familiar with sign language. This app seamlessly converts sign language into text and vice versa in real-time, facilitating clear and effective communication for all users.

Key Features: Real-Time Sign Language to Text Conversion: Utilizes advanced machine learning and computer vision to translate sign language into text instantly. Text to Sign Language Visualization: Converts textual communication into visual sign language representations through natural language processing and animation techniques. Integrated Video Chat Interface: Offers a user-friendly video chat interface that integrates sign language to text translation, ensuring a smooth user experience. Pre-Set Communication Templates: Includes commonly used phrases and responses to facilitate quicker and easier communication. Customizable Accessibility Options: Features adjustable text sizes, fonts, and color contrasts to cater to users with different visual preferences and needs. Motivation

The inspiration behind this project is to create a world where communication is inclusive and accessible to everyone, regardless of their hearing ability. By leveraging technology, we aim to bridge the gap between different modes of communication and foster a more connected and understanding society.
