Video Chatting App with Sign Language to Text Conversion

Project Overview

Welcome to our repository for an innovative video chatting app designed to break down communication barriers between the deaf or hard-of-hearing community and those who are not familiar with sign language. This app seamlessly converts sign language into text and vice versa in real-time, facilitating clear and effective communication for all users.

Key Features: Real-Time Sign Language to Text Conversion: Utilizes advanced machine learning and computer vision to translate sign language into text instantly. Text to Sign Language Visualization: Converts textual communication into visual sign language representations through natural language processing and animation techniques. Integrated Video Chat Interface: Offers a user-friendly video chat interface that integrates sign language to text translation, ensuring a smooth user experience. Pre-Set Communication Templates: Includes commonly used phrases and responses to facilitate quicker and easier communication. Customizable Accessibility Options: Features adjustable text sizes, fonts, and color contrasts to cater to users with different visual preferences and needs. Motivation

The inspiration behind this project is to create a world where communication is inclusive and accessible to everyone, regardless of their hearing ability. By leveraging technology, we aim to bridge the gap between different modes of communication and foster a more connected and understanding society.

Target Audience
